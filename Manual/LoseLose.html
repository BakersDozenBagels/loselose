                    <p>The module consists of one block of text. When starting, there's a warning stating that it might delete assets.</p>
					<p><strong>This is not a joke. The module may delete critical instances necessary to keep the game running.</strong> You can always reboot your game if it becomes unplayable, as it never deletes physical files.</p>
					<p>If you solve any module before it activates, the module will strike. To prevent this; select the module, which will start running the payload. From then on, after any* solved module, the text will change.</p>
					<p></p>

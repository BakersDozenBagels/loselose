                        The module will have chosen a random <code>png</code> or
                        <code>jpg</code> image from e926.net using the default
                        blacklist*. Find the image's numeric id and input it
                        into the module one digit at a time by pressing on the
                        image that many times (or ten times to input a zero) and
                        waiting for a bit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Pressing the status light will make the module choose a
                        new image, but be aware: each time you do this, you will
                        have to wait exponentially longer for it to happen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the module fails to get an image for whatever reason,
                        you can submit 0 to solve it.
